"My name is Austin Holmes. I am the Enterprise Application Specialist and Database Administrator for Dougherty County School System. This repository consists of SQL Scripts I created while developing reports for Dougherty County School System. The database management system used is Microsoft SQL Server. This README file will be updated accordingly as I add more SQL scripts from work. DUE TO CONFIDENTIALLY, ALL OF THE TABLES USED IN THE SCRIPTS ARE ALIASES".
