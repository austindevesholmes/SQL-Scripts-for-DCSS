# SQL-Scripts-for-DCSS
Hello my name is Austin Holmes. I am the Enterprise Application Specialist and Database Administrator for Dougherty County School System. 
This repository consists of SQL Scripts I created while developing reports for Dougherty County School System. 
The database management system used is Microsoft SQL Server.
This README file will be updated accordingly as I add more SQL scripts from work. 

*Public Housing Query- 

This script was created to determine what students were living in section 8 housing.
